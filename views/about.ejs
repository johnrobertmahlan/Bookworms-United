        Hi there! Welcome to <strong>Bookworms United!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're like me, you can't walk past a bookstore without stopping in and having a look around. It doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing; if there's a bookstore in sight, you've got to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if there <em>isn't</em> a bookstore in sight? What if you're traveling and want to find the best bookstores wherever you are? Or what if you're new in town and need to find your new favorite bookstore?
    </p>
    <p>
        That's where we come in. Think of Bookworms United as Goodreads, but for book<em>stores</em>. You can <a href="/bookstores">browse</a> bookstores in your area and see where they are, what they're known for, and what your fellow bookworms have to say about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you <a href="/auth/google">log in</a>, you can share your thoughts about any bookstore or, if you know of a great bookstore that isn't already listed, add it to our collection.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why not take a look around? You might just find your next favorite bookstore!
    </p>
